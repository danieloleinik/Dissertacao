  abstract  = {The Smart Grid of the future, while expected to
affect all areas of the Electric Power System, from Generation, to
Transmission, to Distribution, cannot function without an
extensive data communication system. Smart Grid has the
potential to support high levels of Distributed Generation (DG);
however the current standards governing the interconnection of
DG do not allow the implementation of several applications
which may be beneficial to the grid. This paper discusses some of
the Smart Grid applications, and estimates the communication
requirements of a medium data intensive Smart Grid device.
Two issues that will become very important with the spread of
DG are DG Islanding and DG Availability. For each issue, we
propose data communication enabled solutions and
enhancements.},
